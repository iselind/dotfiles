# Review skill

Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`

<!-- Both commands use an explicit merge-base to avoid git's inconsistent two/three-dot
     behaviour: `git log A...B` is symmetric difference (both sides), whereas
     `git diff A...B` diffs from merge-base to B. Using $(git merge-base) with `..`
     makes the intent explicit and consistent: show commits/changes from the fork point
     to HEAD, nothing more. The fetch ensures origin/main is current. -->
Branch commits (vs main): !`git fetch origin main -q 2>/dev/null; git log $(git merge-base origin/main HEAD)..HEAD --oneline`

Changed files: !`git diff $(git merge-base origin/main HEAD)..HEAD --stat`

## Your job

You have multiple phases. Complete them in order.

---

## Phase 1 — Review & populate the plan

**Step 1 — Find the plan**

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, use that path as the plan file. The provided file
might not be the right one, so check the file contents to confirm it is a
tracking plan with a status table and detailed sections. If it doesn't look like
a plan, tell the user and ask for clarification. Look through the branch's
changes for any added or modified plan files that might be relevant and ask the
user which plan found issues should go into.

Otherwise, search the repository for a tracking plan. Look for markdown files
whose names suggest a readiness checklist, review tracker, or issue list
(e.g. `*readiness*.md`, `*review*.md`, `*plan*.md`, `*tracker*.md`) in
`.github/`, `docs/plans/`, and the repo root.

If no plan exists, tell the user and ask where to create one before proceeding. The
preferred pattern is a separate `<plan-name>-review.md` file alongside the plan (e.g.
`helm-chart-migration-review.md` for `helm-chart-migration.md`). This keeps the plan
itself clean — it records what to do, not what reviewers found. The review file is
deleted when all items are resolved; it never outlives the plan it accompanies.

**Step 2 — Read the plan**

Read the plan file. Understand:
- The format of the status table (columns, status emoji conventions, item numbering)
- The format of detailed sections (how each item is written below the table)
- The highest existing item number (so you can continue the sequence)
- Which items are already open (⬜) vs resolved (✅)

**Step 3 — Review the branch**

Read the full diff and all changed files. Identify issues across these categories:
- **Bug** — code that is incorrect or could fail
- **Security** — credentials, injection risk, over-permissive access
- **Suggestion** — correct but improvable patterns or inconsistencies
- **Verification** — things that must be confirmed before merge
- **Cleanup** — dead code, stale comments, misleading names
- **Minor** — low-impact observations worth recording

For each issue, check the existing plan items — skip anything already tracked
(open or resolved).

**Step 4 — Add new items to the plan**

For each new issue, in one edit:
1. Append a row to the status table: `| N | Short description | Type | ⬜ Open |`
2. Append a detailed section at the bottom of the file, following the exact
   heading, paragraph, and code-block style already used in the document.

If no new issues were found, say so clearly. If there are existing open (⬜)
items in the plan, skip to Phase 2. If there are no open items at all, skip to
Phase 3.

After editing, tell the user: "Added items N–M to the plan. Ready to start
with the next open issue?" — then wait for confirmation before beginning Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2 — Work through open issues one at a time

Work through open (⬜) items in ascending order, one at a time.

**For each item:**

1. State the item number and describe the problem: what is wrong, where it is,
   and why it matters. Do not propose a fix yet — let the user engage with the
   problem first. Wait for the user to respond.

2. Once the user has engaged, propose a fix (and alternatives if they exist).
   If there are alternatives, ask the user to confirm which one to implement
   before proceeding.

3. Fix the issue. Read the relevant files first. Make the minimal, focused
   change that resolves the item.

4. Update the plan: change `⬜ Open` to `✅ Done — <one-line resolution>` in
   the status table row for that item.

5. Stop and report what you did. Show the specific change (inline or as a
   brief diff summary) so the user has something concrete to review. End with:
   "Ready for review — let me know when you're ready to commit." Then wait.

6. When the user confirms: commit with a message in the style already used on
   this branch (look at recent commits for the pattern). Then ask: "Ready for
   item N+1?" and wait.

**Do not work on the next item until the user confirms the current one.**

If you reach the last open item and complete it, follow the normal confirmation
flow for that item (step 4 → user confirms → step 5 commit) before proceeding
to phase 3.

## Phase 3 — Extract architectural decisions

Move directly into `/extract-adr`. Do not ask for permission — this is a
natural continuation of the review.

**Important:** Phase 3 runs before Phase 4 deliberately. The review tracking
file may contain resolutions that are architectural decisions worth capturing
as ADRs (e.g., a bug fix that required choosing between approaches). The
extract-adr skill needs access to this file before it is deleted.

## Phase 4 — Delete the review tracking file

After the ADR extraction commit(s), read the review tracking file. Check
whether all items are resolved (no ⬜ Open rows remain). Report your
assessment to the user — either "all items resolved, ready to delete" or a
summary of what remains open — and ask for confirmation before deleting. Once
confirmed, delete the file and commit the deletion in its own dedicated commit
— do not bundle it with any other changes. Use a message in the style already
used on this branch.

---

## Conventions to follow

- Never skip an item without explaining why it is not applicable.
- If an item turns out to be a non-issue on closer inspection, update the plan
  to `✅ Accepted — <reason>` rather than silently skipping it.
- After resolving any item (done, accepted, or otherwise), consider whether the
  code that triggered the finding is still ambiguous enough that a future
  reviewer would raise the same question. If so, propose a clarifying change
  (e.g. a better comment, a more explicit name). The item's resolution fixes the
  *issue*; the clarifying change fixes the *trigger*.
- Keep fixes minimal — this is a review pass, not a refactor.
- If a fix has meaningful risk or side effects, flag it before proceeding.

## Phase 5 — Retrospective

After all previous phases are complete, ask:

> "How did the **review** skill perform? Anything to do differently next
> time — steps to add, remove, or change?"

If the user has no feedback, end here.

If the user provides feedback:

1. Read the current skill file at
   `/home/patrik/.claude/skills/review/SKILL.md`
2. Make targeted edits that address the feedback — do not rewrite the file from
   scratch
3. The user reviews the changes via the IDE diff
4. Resolve the symlink `~/.claude/skills` to find the dotfiles repo, then
   commit and push the skill file change from that repo
5. Changes take effect on the next invocation of this skill
