DEBUGGING                               *debugging*

TRACING VARIABLE ASSIGNMENTS            *debugging-var-assignment*

To get a complete trace of where variables get set, take a look at the -V
option for vim. An example
>
    vim -V20vimlog myfile.txt
<
This command will save a complete log over all assignements and then some to
the file named vimlog in the current directory.

TRACING SCRIPT LOADING                  *debugging-script-loading*

After vim has loaded, execute the following command
>
   :scriptnames
<
This will output all script that has been loaded and in which order.
